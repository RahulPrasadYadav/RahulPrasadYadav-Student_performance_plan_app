# Student Performance Prediction & Personalized Learning Plan

A machine learning web app that predicts student academic performance based on demographic, behavioral, and academic inputs — and generates tailored learning plans to guide student improvement.

Overview
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict student outcomes with high accuracy and generate actionable learning strategies. The app is built with Streamlit for an interactive user experience and uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for visual insights into student performance trends and key influencing features


🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

Web App Framework: Streamlit
